# Arduino-Talking-Thermometer-using-WT588D--U32
The WTD588D project file now contains high quality speech for a wide range of measuring instrument projects. It is part of a series of projects aimed at the Visually Impared. An OLED display has been added for convienience.

Using a WT588D - U 32m audio module and a DS18B20 sensor to build a talking thermometer, the WT588D is used in 3 line mode. For more information on this project see my blog here https://rydepier.wordpress.com/2016/03/01/talking-measurements/.

The code used allows integer numbers up to 9999 and decimal numbers up to 9999.9 to be spoken easily.
